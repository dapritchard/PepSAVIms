Description: An implementation of the data processing and data analysis portion
    of the PepSAVI-MS pipeline developed by first author Christine
    Kirkpatrick and the Hicks Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, as
    presented in the paper \emph{The "PepSAVI-MS" Pipeline for Natural Product
    Bioactive Peptide Discovery} (DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03625). The
    statistical analysis package presented herein provides a collection of
    software tools used to facilitate the prioritization of putative bioactive
    peptides from a complex biological matrix.  Tools are provided to
    deconvolute mass spectrometry features into a single representation for each
    peptide charge state, filter compounds to include only those possibly
    contributing to the observed bioactivity, and prioritize these remaining
    compounds for those most likely contributing to each bioactivity data set.
